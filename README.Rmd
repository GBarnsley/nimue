## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This code is released with no support. Please submit any questions or bugs as [issues](https://github.com/mrc-ide/nimue/issues) and we will try to address them as quickly as possible.

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter name and behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.

:warning: The model is stochastic. Multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.

:warning: As with any mathematical model, it is easy to misconfigure inputs and therefore get meaningless outputs. Please contact the authors if you intend to publish results using `nimue`.

The goal of nimue is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of nimue from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nimue")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/nimue")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(nimue)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
